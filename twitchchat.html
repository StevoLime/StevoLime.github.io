This code is developed by Steven Anderson, aka StevoLime.
This is made to send a whisper/direct message on twitch by url.
Including the correct variables in the URL will have it connect to twitch and send a whisper.
This was designed to use with animal crossing turnip queue from a google sheets document.

required variables:
oId = oauth code from twitch
uId = your twitch username as lowercase
recipientId = the recipient's twitch username as lowercase
codeId = is the message to send

-->
<script type="text/javascript">
var urlParam = function(name, w){
    w = w || window;
    var rx = new RegExp('[\&|\?]'+name+'=([^\&\#]+)'),
        val = w.location.search.match(rx);
    return !val ? '':val[1];
}
var oId = urlParam('oId');
var uId = urlParam('uId');
var recipientId = urlParam('recipientId');
var codeId = urlParam('codeId');

var exampleSocket = new WebSocket("wss://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv:443");

exampleSocket.onopen = function (event) {
	exampleSocket.send("PASS " + oId + "\r\n");
	exampleSocket.send("NICK " + uId + "\r\n");
	exampleSocket.send("USER " + uId + "\r\n");
	exampleSocket.send("CAP REQ :twitch.tv/membership \r\n");
	exampleSocket.send("JOIN #" + uId + "\r\n");

	exampleSocket.send("PRIVMSG #" + uId + " :/w " + recipientId + " " + codeId + "\r\n");
	exampleSocket.onmessage = function (event) {
		console.log(event.data);
		var chatMsg = event.data;
		if (chatMsg.includes("PING")) {
			exampleSocket.send("PONG :tmi.twitch.tv");
			console.log("PONG Sent")
		}
